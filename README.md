# Embedded C Design Patterns

This repository contains examples of design patterns implemented in embedded C. The goal is to demonstrate how common design patterns can be applied in the context of embedded systems programming.

The examples were developed based on the Martin K. Schr√∂der course "Design Patterns in Embedded C" available on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/embedded-c-programming-design-patterns/?srsltid=AfmBOoq7tYXLs5xy7H3ZCYdd2eG4GdPBi336JkoWeg7D51fpguUF-v9z&couponCode=ST4MT20725A) (also available on YouTube).

## Patterns

### Object pattern

The object pattern is a design pattern that encapsulates data and behavior in a single structure, similar to an object in object-oriented programming. It allows for better organization of code and promotes encapsulation. The object pattern was implemented in the `object` source and header files.

### Interface pattern

The interface pattern defines a contract for behavior that can be implemented by different objects. It allows for polymorphism and decouples the code from specific implementations. The interface pattern was implemented in the `interface` source and header files.
