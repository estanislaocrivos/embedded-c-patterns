# Embedded C Design Patterns

This repository contains examples of design patterns implemented in embedded C. The goal is to demonstrate how common design patterns can be applied in the context of embedded systems programming.

The examples were developed based on the Martin K. Schr√∂der course "Design Patterns in Embedded C" available on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/embedded-c-programming-design-patterns/?srsltid=AfmBOoq7tYXLs5xy7H3ZCYdd2eG4GdPBi336JkoWeg7D51fpguUF-v9z&couponCode=ST4MT20725A) (also available on YouTube).
